This simple library is meant as glue between the OCFA framework and
the CarvFS filesystem. It allows for the creation and usage of growing
sparse archives that map to a CarvFS mount.

The current version works wit a single CarvFS mountpoint. 
Future versions may work with a number of mountpoints that is correlated 
to the number of CPU's in the system, as to make sure the single CarvFS
process does not become a botlenech for OCFA.
